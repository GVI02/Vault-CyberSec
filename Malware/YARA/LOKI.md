Run LOKI in local directory:
```bash
python loki.py -p .
```

Give the path to the loki.py file if not in the local directory.

##### Signatures

LOKI uses signatures to detect files.

YARA signatures can be found in:
```
Loki/signature-base
```

If signature directory is missing or you want to update to the most up-to-date signatures use:
```bash
python loki.py --update
```
