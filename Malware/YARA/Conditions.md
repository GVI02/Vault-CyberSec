##### Examples

```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
		$hello_world
}
```

The above rule will match files that contain the "Hello World" sting.

```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
	stings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"
		$hello_world_lowercase = "hello world!"
		$hello_world_uppercase = "HELLO WORLD!"

	condition:
		any of them
}
```

The above rule will match any file that has any of the three strings in it.

```yara
rule helloworld_checker {
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
		#hello_world <= 10
}
```

The above rule will match any file that has 10 or less occurrences of the "Hello World!" sting in it.

```yara
rule helloworld_checker{
	strings:
		$hello_world = "Hello World!"

	condition:
		$hello_world and filesize <= 10KB
}
```

The above rule will match any file that contains the "Hello World!" string **and** has a size of less than or equal to 10 kilobytes.
